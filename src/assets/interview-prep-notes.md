## üß† Angular 17 Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. **What are the key features introduced in Angular 17?**
- **Signal-based Components**: A new reactive primitive replacing RxJS for simpler state management.
- **Built-in Control Flow Syntax**: Replaces `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and `ngSwitch` with `@if`, `@for`, `@switch`.
- **Deferred Loading (`@defer`)**: Lazy loading parts of templates for performance.
- **Standalone Components**: No need for NgModules.
- **Improved SSR & Hydration**: Better server-side rendering and client hydration.
- **ESBuild Integration**: Faster builds and better performance.

### 2. **What are Signal-based components?**
- Signals are **synchronous**, **track dependencies automatically**, and **reduce re-renders**.
- They offer a **simpler alternative to RxJS**.
```ts
import { signal } from '@angular/core';

export class MyComponent {
  count = signal(0);
  increment() {
    this.count.set(this.count() + 1);
  }
}
```
**Benefits**: Better performance, easier state management.

### 3. **What is the new control flow syntax?**
- Replaces structural directives with:
  - `@if`, `@else`, `@else if`
  - `@switch`, `@case`, `@default`
  - `@for`, `@empty`, `@end`
```html
@for (user of users; track user.id) {
  <li>{{ user.name }}</li>
}

@if (isLoggedIn) {
  <p>Welcome!</p>
} @else {
  <p>Please log in.</p>
}
```
**Advantages**: Better readability, performance, and type narrowing.

---

### 4. **How do Standalone Components work?**
- No need for NgModules.
- Declared with `standalone: true`.
```ts
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-hello',
  template: `<h1>Hello Angular 17!</h1>`,
})
export class HelloComponent {}
```
**Use case**: Simplifies component reuse and testing.

---

### 5. **How does Angular 17 improve performance?**
- **Signals** reduce unnecessary re-renders.
- **@defer** enables lazy loading.
- **ESBuild** speeds up builds.
- **Tree-shaking** removes unused code.

---

### 6. **How to migrate to Angular 17?**
- Run: `ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`
- Refactor to standalone components.
- Replace RxJS with Signals.
- Use new control flow syntax.
- Enable `@defer` for lazy loading.

## üß™ TypeScript & JavaScript Interview Questions

### üîπ TypeScript Questions
| Question | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| What is TypeScript? | A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. |
| Difference between `interface` and `type`? | `interface` is extendable; `type` is more flexible (can use unions, etc.). |
| What is `readonly`? | Prevents reassignment of properties. |
| What is `Partial<T>`? | Makes all properties optional. |
| What is `Omit<T, K>`? | Removes keys `K` from type `T`. |

---

### üîπ JavaScript Questions
| Question | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| What is hoisting? | JS moves declarations to the top of scope. |
| What are closures? | Functions that remember variables from their outer scope. |
| Difference between `==` and `===`? | `==` allows type coercion; `===` checks type and value. |
| What is a Promise? | An object representing future completion of an async task. |
| What is event delegation? | Handling events at a parent level instead of individual child elements. |

## üîç Output-Based Problems with Explanations

### üß† JavaScript
```js
console.log(typeof null); // ?
```
**Output**: `"object"`  
**Explanation**: Historical bug in JS.

---

```js
let x = [1, 2, 3];
x[10] = 99;
console.log(x.length); // ?
```
**Output**: `11`  
**Explanation**: Sparse arrays fill gaps with `undefined`.

---

```js
(function() {
  var a = b = 3;
})();
console.log(typeof b); // ?
```
**Output**: `"number"`  
**Explanation**: `b` becomes global because `var a = b = 3` is interpreted as `b = 3; var a = b;`

---

### üß† TypeScript
```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
};

const p: Person = { name: "Alice" };
console.log(p.age ?? 25); // ?
```
**Output**: `25`  
**Explanation**: `??` returns right-hand value if left is `null` or `undefined`.

---

```ts
function greet(name: string | null) {
  console.log(name?.toUpperCase());
}
greet(null); // ?
```
**Output**: `undefined`  
**Explanation**: Optional chaining prevents error if `name` is null.
