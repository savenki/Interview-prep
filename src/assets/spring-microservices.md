# üß† Spring Boot Microservices Interview Guide

---

## üìò 1. Microservices Fundamentals

### Q1: What are microservices?
**Answer**: Microservices are independently deployable services that encapsulate a specific business capability. They communicate via APIs and are loosely coupled, unlike monolithic systems.

### Q2: How does Spring Boot support microservices?
**Answer**: Spring Boot simplifies microservice development with:
- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty)
- Auto-configuration
- Production-ready metrics via Actuator
- Integration with Spring Cloud for distributed systems.

---

## üîó 2. Communication Between Microservices

### Q3: How do microservices communicate?
**Answer**:
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs using `RestTemplate` or `WebClient`
- **Asynchronous**: Messaging via Kafka, RabbitMQ
- **Binary**: gRPC for high-performance communication.

### Q4: What is Spring Cloud Stream?
**Answer**: A framework for building event-driven microservices using messaging middleware like Kafka or RabbitMQ.

---

## üß≠ 3. Service Discovery and API Gateway

### Q5: What is service discovery?
**Answer**: Enables services to register and discover each other dynamically. Tools: **Eureka**, **Consul**.

### Q6: What is an API Gateway?
**Answer**: Acts as a single entry point for clients. Handles routing, authentication, rate limiting. Tools: **Spring Cloud Gateway**, **Zuul**.

---

## üöÄ 4. Deployment and Containerization

### Q7: How do you deploy microservices?
**Answer**:
- **Docker**: Containerize each service
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrate containers, manage scaling and failover
- **CI/CD**: Automate builds and deployments using Jenkins, GitHub Actions.

### Q8: What is the role of containers?
**Answer**: Containers encapsulate the app and its dependencies, ensuring consistent deployment across environments.

---

## üìà 5. Scaling and Load Balancing

### Q9: How do you scale microservices?
**Answer**:
- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more instances
- **Kubernetes**: Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory
- **Load balancing**: Spring Cloud LoadBalancer or Ribbon (deprecated).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6. Configuration and Tuning

### Q10: What is Spring Cloud Config?
**Answer**: Centralized configuration management using Git-backed repositories. Supports dynamic refresh with Actuator endpoints.

### Q11: How do you tune performance?
**Answer**:
- Use **HikariCP** for DB connection pooling
- Enable **caching** with Redis or Caffeine
- Optimize thread pools and memory settings
- Monitor with Actuator, Prometheus, Grafana.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 7. Resilience and Fault Tolerance

### Q12: What is a Circuit Breaker?
**Answer**: Prevents cascading failures by stopping calls to failing services. Tools: **Resilience4j**, **Hystrix (deprecated)**.

### Q13: What is the Retry pattern?
**Answer**: Automatically retries failed requests. Spring Retry integrates with Resilience4j.

---

## üîç 8. Observability and Monitoring

### Q14: How do you monitor microservices?
**Answer**:
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Health, metrics, and info endpoints
- **Distributed tracing**: Spring Cloud Sleuth + Zipkin
- **Logging**: Centralized with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

---

## üîê 9. Security

### Q15: How do you secure microservices?
**Answer**:
- Use **Spring Security** for authentication/authorization
- Implement **OAuth2** and **JWT** for token-based security
- Secure communication with HTTPS and SSL.

---

## üß† 10. Advanced Patterns

### Q16: What is the Saga pattern?
**Answer**: Manages distributed transactions across microservices using a sequence of local transactions and compensating actions.

### Q17: What is CQRS?
**Answer**: Separates read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.

---

## üß™ 11. Testing Microservices

### Q18: How do you test microservices?
**Answer**:
- **Unit Testing**: JUnit, Mockito
- **Integration Testing**: TestContainers, WireMock
- **Contract Testing**: Pact for consumer-driven contracts

---

## üßæ 12. Common Pitfalls

### Q19: What are challenges in microservices?
**Answer**:
- Data consistency
- Network latency
- Debugging distributed systems
- Managing configuration and secrets

---

## üß≠ Final Tips

- Prepare real-world examples of how you scaled or tuned services.
- Be ready to diagram architecture and explain trade-offs.
- Know the latest tools and trends (e.g., gRPC, Kubernetes, Resilience4j).
